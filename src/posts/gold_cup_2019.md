<!-- TODO make some jokes here -->

The US Men's National Team lost the Gold Cup Final 0-1 to Mexico. It was a frustrating and ugly defeat for the US, and furthermore it was a to a Mexico squad that didn't include most of their best players who play club football in Europe. However if you consider where the US team was and how they looked before the Gold Cup started, this result is ultimately a success for them. Just reaching the final seemed out of reach for this batch of players, but they were able to come together and improve as a squad throughout the tournament, and they held their own against Mexico. Here are a few thoughts, reflections, and pain points on the players who played significant minutes for the US in this Gold Cup.

 <!-- TODO decide on order  -->

### Christian Pulisic

I don't this is an exaggeration to say: Pulisic is already the most talented player to ever play for the U.S. His skill level now as a 20 year old is higher than Landon Donovan's or Clint Dempsey's ever was. Now to be clear, that doesn't mean I think he's a better player or more important player than either of those two yet. His talent level is higher, but he needs to turn that talent into results- results like beating Mexico in the Gold Cup, or qualifying for the World Cup, and he hasn't done either of those yet. Pulisic was the best player for the US at this Gold Cup, but he disappeared for most of the second half against Mexico. He also struggled to make an impact against a well-organized Cura√ßao team. The next step for him to take is showing up when the US needs him most and taking over games against tough opposition.

### Aaron Long

I was incredibly impressed by Aaron Long's performances throughout this tournament. I was less impressed by his rat-tail haircut. Maybe that's why he has it, though - if it causes a single opposition player to choke on his own spit in shock and disgust, then it is worth keeping. Long looked athletic, good in the air, confident on the ball, and played a few really nice long passes over the top to Altidore and Pulisic. I know Omar Gonzales set a low, low bar for center backs for the US, Aaron Long looked like a really good center back, not just a player who is nominally better than Omar Gonzales.

### Gyasi Zardes

Gyasi might have the worst first touch of any player to ever play for international soccer for the US, much less make an appearance in a Gold Cup Final. Yet somehow, he scored the [goal of the tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beyKW_MHt5w). I don't understand how he keeps getting callups and minutes. He's not the kind of MLS player that the US should be calling up. I never thought I would say this, but Gyasi's first touch makes me look back fondly on the days when Chris Wondolowski was missing open net sitters for the national team.

### Michael Bradley

Michael Bradley seems like he has been 35 years old since the 2010 World Cup, yet somehow this time wizard is only 31. Don't let that fool you though- he's stil out there jogging around and failing to complete ten foot passes in midfield like his 90<sup>th</sup> birthday was yesterday. Bradley is older and slower than ever. However, despite all of his shortcomings, I understand why he is still getting minutes. Against lesser opposition that sick back and defend, Bradley can do a great job recycling possesion and playing the occasional diagonal to keep the offense ticking. He isn't dynamic enough to play against top opposition, and seems to give the ball away multiple times a match, but there isn't a player ready to replace him yet. That player should be Tyler Adams in the future, but he missed this Gold Cup due to injury. I eagerly await the day Bradley is not called up for internation duty.

### Nick Lima

Nick Lima is ultimately a depth option once DeAndre Yedlin is back from injury, but he did not disappoint in the chances he was given. He didn't do much to impress either, but at least he didn't disappoint.

### Paul Arriola

Paul Arriola on paper is relatively average, but he is the ultimate _MAXIMUM EFFORT_ player and that transforms his perfomances for the US. Every team needs a player who is a complete gym rat, pure hustle and energy- think Matuidi for France at the World Cup. Arriola seems to be that player for the US. He was almost playing like a wing-back at times, defending deep to help protect Tim Ream from more pacey attackers, but then he would show up in the box thirty seconds later trying to get on the end of a cross. He may not be the most talented player on the team, but he plays his heart out every game, and its great to have a player like that.

### Tim Ream

Tim Ream is another player I was surprisingly impressed with. He's not a natural fullback, and will never have the pace to play that position against top wingers, but he used his positional awareness to mask his physical shortcomings and never looked out of his depth defending out wide. He also was the best passer in defense for the US, constantly playing progressive balls forward to spring Arriola or Pulisic in the channel or over the top of the defense.

### Tyler Boyd

In the first match of the group stage, Tyler Boyd looked like one the best players in attack for the US, but he slowly faded as the tournament progressed. It's great to score a double against Guyana, but he will be disappointed to not even come off the bench against Mexico. Boyd was replaced by Jordan Morris in the starting lineup for the semifinal and the final, and it seemed like Morris offered more in defense, as well as being more direct on the ball in offense. Boyd is a promising player, but needs to do more to not disappear from games.

### Walker Zimmerman

Zimmerman looked okay in defense, but never really stood out. Ultimately he is competing to be the number one backup for John Brooks once Brooks is healthy again, and ZImmerman played like a replacement-level player.

### Weston McKennie

<!--  START HERE -->

second most talented player, but most important. attackers (pulisic) luxury, midfielder essential for competing against top team. can slot in anywhere, seems to be most important in a deeper role, but still shows up in the box to score

### Zack Steffen

bright spot, a few misteps but solid keeper already. filling howards boots well

### Jordan Morris

rotation player, talented, lots of energy. disappears from games offensively but does defensive work, and is fast aggressive, not afraid to shoot

### Jozy Altidore

talented and strong, clearly the best us striker despite still struggling to recover from injuries.

### Reggie Cannon

athletic but clearly a young and inexperienced player. played some good crosses and contributed a lot offensively, but still a lot to learn

### Matt Miazga

did not stand out. misplaced passes. could be an option in the future, but not good enough yet

### Christian Roldan

### Daniel Lovitz
