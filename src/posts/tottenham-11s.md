If you’re reading this, chances are you really miss football. I do too. To help distract myself from the pit of despair that is the current state of affairs, I’ve made a few different flavors of “Best 11” lineups for Tottenham Hotspur over the past decade. I considered all the players that have played for Tottenham since the 2010-11 season until now, but I’m only considering the performances since that mark for players that were on the team in the previous Decade. This means that while I acknowledge Ledley King is a legend and one of the best defenders to ever wear the shirt, he wasn’t at his best by the time the 2010 season kicked off, and isn’t one the two best centerbacks to play for Spurs this decade. Read on to find out who has earned that honor, and more.

#### Actual Best 11

###### Lloris; Rose, Vertonghen, Alderweireld, Walker; Dembele, Modric; Son, Eriksen, Bale; Kane

First, the most straightforward 11 to understand – the actual best 11. These are the 11 best players that played for Tottenham this decade. Besides Ledley King, who I already explained above, the only other controversial omission in my mind is Dele Alli. It is hard to justify putting him ahead of Heung-min Son or Gareth Bale though, as both are better pure scorers than him. Christian Eriksen is a better creator than Dele too, so that leaves him as the first substitute on the bench. You could also argue for a 433 formation to bring in peak Victor Wanyama as a world-class Defensive Midfielder, but it’s too hard to leave Son or Bale off the list. The rest of the lineup doesn’t really need much explanation – it’s the core of the best lineup from the Pochettino era, plus the two best players from the beginning of the decade that catapulted Spurs into regular Champions League contention. This squad would coast through the Premier League Champions league, easily winning both competitions.

#### Handsome 11

###### Vorm; Davies, Vertonghen, King; Son, Dier, Parker, Winks, Chadli; Dele, Llorente

This was a tough 11 to choose, as there were literally dozens of strapping young lads contending for starting spots here. Tottenham has probably won the “Most Handsome” alternate league table for past five years. The competition was tightest in goal, with Michel Vorm’s rugged handsomeness just barely beating out challenges from Hugo Lloris and Paulo Gazzaniga. The defense is anchored by Ledley King, who gives off the vibe of a younger more fit Idris Elba. The midfield trio could be mistaken for a World War 2 fighter pilot crew, headlined by Scott Parker endlessly pirouetting into my dreams. Dele and Hueng-Min Son are both fashion icons with unique styles. Son is joined in the attacking wingback role by none other than The Dolphin himself, Nacer Chadli. Fernando LLorente’s rugged beard and bombastic hips lead the attack. While this lineup offers plenty in attack, and some star names in defense the midfield is full of sideways passers, and neither wingback can actually defend well. Expect lots of 4-4 draws and a date with the Europa league.

#### Heart Attack 11

###### Gomes; Aurier, Chiriches, Foyth, Trippier; NKoudou, Bentaleb, Paulinho, N’Jie; Janssen, Soldado

Yes, I know this team features two nominal right backs in the defense. But if you take a closer look, you will realize that is the least of the worries for this squad. It features wingers who can’t dribble, Strikers who can’t shoot, and center backs whose first instinct is to carry the ball thirty yards up the pitch past three opponents. The crazy thing is that half of these players have had solid careers. Roberto Soldado, Paulinho, Nabil Bentaleb, Vlad Chiriches, Heurelho Gomes, and even Kieran Trippier all have done respectably well at other clubs before or after playing at Spurs. This isn’t the “Worst 11” or “Disappointing 11” (although there may be a few overlaps) - this the Heart Attack 11. These are the 11 players most likely to trigger cardiac arrest with the ball at their feet. This team wouldn’t get relegated, and might even upset a few top teams, but they wouldn’t finish in the top half of the table.

#### Cult Hero 11

##### Friedel; Assou-Ekotto, Wimmer, Dawson, Walker-Peters; Wanyama, Huddlestone, Mason; Lamela, Sigurdsson, Crouch

This squad might be the most eclectic mix yet. Being a cult hero means different things for different people, and there are multiple small cult followings amongst Spurs Fans. Brad Friedel is here not just to satisfy the American fanbase but because he was also a great underrated keeper. Benoit Assou-Ekotto was one of the most nonchalant athletes to grace the premier league. And Kyle-Walker Peters was the biggest youth team talent for years, even though he has yet to actually deliver on his promise. Huddlestone and Wanyama form a fearsome double pivot that delivers a dual threat of bangers and spaghetti plates. Finally, Crouchy leads the line up front, eternally looking like he’s about to fall over. This would be a solid if unexciting midtable team. Very defensively stout, but not enough attacking threat to fight for champions league positions.
