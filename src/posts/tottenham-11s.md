Looking back, it's been an incredible decade for Tottenham Hotspur. I started watching them after the 2010 World Cup, and have been in love since the first kick. The first match of the 2010 season was a truly exhilarating 0-0 draw against Manchester City, and from then on I was hooked. Spurs had their ups and downs. Multiple managers, some more succesful than others, some much more likeable than others. Somehow, Spurs consistently fought for Champions League positions every season, despite Tactics Tim and AVB's best efforts.

Given the lack of Premier League football on TV, I thought now would be a good time to build a few different lineups featuring players from this past decade. Each lineup has different criteria used in picking it, very few of which actually relate to on the field performance. I considered all the players that have played for Tottenham since the 2010-11 season until now, but I’m only considering the performances since that the start of that season. This means that while I acknowledge Ledley King is the best defender to ever wear the shirt, his career was winding down by the time the 2010 season kicked off, and thus isn’t one the two best center backs to play for Spurs this decade. Read on to find out who has earned that honor, and more.

#### Best Eleven

###### Lloris; Rose, Vertonghen, Alderweireld, Walker; Dembele, Modric; Son, Eriksen, Bale; Kane

First, the most straightforward lineup to understand – the actual Best Eleven. These are the eleven best players that played for Tottenham this decade. Besides Ledley King, who I already explained above, the only other controversial omission is Dele Alli. It is hard to justify putting him ahead of Heung-min Son or Gareth Bale though, as both are better pure scorers than him. Christian Eriksen is a better creator than Dele too, so that leaves him as the first substitute on the bench. You could also argue for a 433 formation to bring on peak Victor Wanyama as a world-class defensive midfielder, but it’s too hard to leave Son or Bale off the list. The rest of the lineup doesn’t really need much explanation – it’s the core of the best lineup from the Pochettino era, plus the two best players from the beginning of the decade that catapulted Spurs into regular Champions League contention. This squad would coast through the Premier League and the Champions League, securing the double without breaking a sweat.

#### Handsome Eleven

###### Vorm; Davies, Vertonghen, King; Son, Dier, Parker, Winks, Chadli; Dele, Llorente

This was a tough Eleven to choose, as there are literally dozens of strapping young lads contending for starting spots here. In my totally unbiased eyes, Tottenham has won the “Most Handsome” alternate league table every season this decade. The criteria for this lineup is straightforward: Be good-looking. The competition was tightest in goal, with Michel Vorm’s rugged handsomeness just barely beating out challenges from Hugo Lloris and Paulo Gazzaniga. You really can't go wrong in goal, as they all offer different flavors of male beauty. The defense is anchored by Ledley King, who pulls off "Young Idris Elba" look to perfection. Don't mistake the midfield trio for a World War 2 fighter pilot crew sent forward in time. Scott Parker headlines the squadron, endlessly pirouetting in the center circle. Modern fashion icons Dele and Hueng-Min Son provide the star power further up the pitch. Son is joined in the attacking wingback role by none other than The Dolphin himself, Nacer Chadli. Finally, Fernando LLorente’s rugged beard and powerful hips lead the attack. While this lineup offers plenty in attack and some star names in defense, the midfield is full of sideways passers. Also, neither wingback can actually defend. Expect lots of 4-4 draws and a date with the Europa league.

#### Heart Attack Eleven

###### Gomes; Aurier, Chiriches, Foyth, Trippier; NKoudou, Bentaleb, Paulinho, N’Jie; Janssen, Soldado

There is one criterion for this squad: the eleven players most likely to induce cardiac arrest. I can feel palpitations just looking at the team sheet. And yes, I realize there are two nominal right backs in defense. But if you continue to scan the rest of the team, you will realize that is the least of the team's worries. It has wingers who can’t dribble, strikers who can’t shoot, and center backs who love to dribble the ball straight at the opposition. The wild thing here is that half of these players have had solid careers. Roberto Soldado, Paulinho, Nabil Bentaleb, Vlad Chiriches, Heurelho Gomes, and even Kieran Trippier all have done respectably well at other clubs before or after playing at Spurs. This isn’t the “Worst Eleven” or “Disappointing Eleven” (although there may be a few overlaps) - this the Heart Attack Eleven. This team is good enough to upset a few top teams, but would ultimately finish in middle of the table.

#### Cult Hero Eleven

##### Friedel; Assou-Ekotto, Wimmer, Dawson, Walker-Peters; Wanyama, Huddlestone, Mason; Lamela, Sigurdsson, Crouch

![Cult Hero Eleven](/posts/14/hero.png)

Being a cult hero means different things for different people, which makes it hard to identify a clear, concise, and consistent set of criteria for the squad. That means that there weren't any rules, and ended up with the most eclectic mix yet. Friedel is obviously the token American player. I could have picked Dempsey here, but Brad Friedel was actually a great keeper that isn't appreciated enough, both in the US and the UK. Michael Dawson, Tom Huddlestone, and Ryan Mason are all club legends that the fanbase loves, even if they aren't world class players. Kyle Walker-Peters here represents the youth team devotees and [Windy](https://twitter.com/windycoys)'s eternal optimism. Kevin Wimmer and Gylfi Sigurdsson both briefly seemed like players who were close to making the leap to becoming elite players, but it never worked out for either of them. Victor Wanyama on the other hand was truly elite, but only for eighteen months. We all have a friend or two who still thinks Erik Lamela can be our best player if only he can get a consistent run of game time. Finally, Peter Crouch and his robot dance lead the line. This would be a solid if unexciting midtable team. Very defensively solid, but not enough creativity in attack to fight for champions league positions.
