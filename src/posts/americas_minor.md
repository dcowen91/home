The surprisingly multinational Americas Minor kicks off on Tuesday with eight teams fighting for two spots in the IEM Katowice Major Main Qualifier, and one more team headed to the last-chance qualifier (The qualifier for the qualifier for the... Major! It sounds confusing, but it is really just one extra step). The North American region was allocated six out of the eight qualifying spots, but U.S. and Canada-based teams will find themselves outnumbered here against challengers from the South. There are four teams here with almost entirely Brazilian rosters (19 Brazilian players and one token Argentine, NikoM for TeamOne), and finally one South African squad that is currently playing in Texas. Let's go over a few bold and not-so-bold predictions for the event!

### Qualifying Team #1: NRG

NRG are a top 10 team in the world and are far and away more talented and experienced as a roster than any other competitors here. On paper, they should easily advance. However, that was exactly what we said about them last time at the FACEIT Minor back in July, where they failed to advance after losing bo3s to CompLexity and eUnited. This time should be different though, as they've had some great results and performances in the six months since then. They won two international LANS (IEM Shangahi and SuperNova CS:GO Malta), took second at another (cs_summit 3), and placed top four at two others (ESL One New York and StarSeries i-League Season 6). No other team here has even attended that many international LANs, much less matched those kinds of offline performances. Those LAN victories should give them the confidence and experience to handle the opposition here, and they should qualify comfortably.

### Qualifying Team #2: eUnited

eUnited have shuffled through a handful of players in recent months, but I think this current iteration actually makes sense. dazzle is a complete player, so having him back is definitely a good thing for the team. I feel for Relyks though, because he's also a really likeable and earnest player. But the move to cut him and bring back dazzle makes sense, in a way that benching dazzle in the first place never did. And going back before that, Cooper- and FNS are both great pickups, even if the ways they were done was questionable. FNS is a great veteran IGL who can guide this squad that has been branded "up and coming" for what feels like an eternity now. They should be able to advance from here.

### Advance to Last Change Qualifier: Bravado

This South African lineup has been around for a while but started turning heads in November when they took second at Dreamhack Open Winter, where they beat G2 and Optic in bo1s before losing to ENCE in the final. They are in NRG's group, so barring an upset, they shouldn't have to play them in the playoffs and will have an easy path to taking the third qualifying spot.

### Biggest Disappointment Award: Envy

Karrigan is a great IGL and talent-wise a step above the majority of the players in attendance at this LAN, but he has yet to play an official round with any of his teammates on Envy. Even great teams take time to gel together, and a bootcamp isn't the easiest way to add a stranger to a roster. Nifty and JDM are both meteoric talents who can either shine brightly or crash out at any time, sometimes doing both during the same round. But at this point reltuC is literally 30 years old, and everyone knows that it spells Cutler backwards at this point, so he doesn't have the element of surprise on his side anymore. He's still fragging decently, but is never going to carry a team, and that's what this team needs. Drone feels like a younger, more raw version of Cutler, so that doesn't really help things either. This team needs to make a few moves before it will be ready to take the leap.

### This team is probably good but I don't follow Brazilian CS enough to know for sure Award: INTZ

kNgV- played on the highly successful but short-lived Immortals team when they took second at the PGL Krakow Major. Chelo is a hyper-talented up-and-coming player who has been on the cusp of a breakthrough for a while. yeL seems like he has been around for as long reltuC on various Brazilian squads. They qualified with the #1 seed from South America. This team is probably super good, but since I don't follow Brazilian CS, I'm probably overlooking them.

### Did You Know?

FURIA and TeamOne are the only two teams with no players with previous Major experience. Envy has by far the most Major experience, four different players having attending a combined 25 Majors (karrigan accounts for 12 of those).
