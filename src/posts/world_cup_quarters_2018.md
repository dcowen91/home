To steal a classic Stephen Colbert line, has this been the greatest World Cup or the greatest World Cup of all time? Currently, it's on pace to be the greatest of all time. Upsets, failed comebacks, successful comebacks, penalty shoot-outs, [terrible hair cuts](https://twitter.com/JamesDoddUK/status/1013127902450409474) (don't let me understate how bad it is), heroes and great stories to root for (England and It Coming Home), villains giving you an easy reason to root loudly against them (Neymar and his injury theatrics), and villains to root against but not too loudly due to fear of cyber-retribution (Russia). After all this, we're set for an excellent Quarter-Final weekend with four great matchups.

#### Uruguay v France

Uruguay beat Egypt in a not-as-close-as-it-looks 1-0 on the opening day of the tournament and haven't skipped a beat since. They didn't concede a goal in the group stage, and completely shut down Cristiano Ronaldo while beating Portugal 2-1 in the round of 16. Their biggest problem is that they lost Cavani to injury in that game. They will struggle as they don't have any other attackers like him to combine with Luis Suarez. Cavani does so much work off the ball and in transition that most players can't replicate. Suarez will need to step up and take charge offensively for Uruguay to advance.

France on the other hand started the tournament slowly and never looked comfortable in the group stage, despite winning their group. They then dominated the vast majority of the game against Argentina, where Kylian Mbapp√© provided the best individual performance of the tournament so far. They did concede three goals to a very average Argentina side in that same game, though, so even that result is a mixed bag. Blaise Matuidi is the all-energy, do-everything type of player that most winning international teams seem to have lately, but he's suspended for this match.

This should be a cagey match, with both teams not looking to be exposed defensively. Uruguay will sit back and soak up pressure, while France will field both Kante and Tolisso for plenty of defensive cover while controlling the ball. Despite how hot and cold France have looked in Russia, Uruguay without Cavani shouldn't be able to muster enough offensive firepower to break through here.

##### France 1-0 Uruguay

#### Brazil v Belgium

Brazil are another team that started the tournament slow, but they've turned it on their past two games, consecutive 2-0 victories against talented Serbia and Mexico teams. While their offensive stars haven't quite lit up the stage as expected, their defense has more than delivered the goods. Casemiro is suspended for this game, but Fernandinho is a natural replacement that is more than capable of shielding the back line.

Belgium almost fell victim to the greatest upset of the tournament when they were 2-0 down to Japan in the 52nd minute. It turns out the Japanese attack was more of a kamikaze than anything, though, as Belgium were able to get the three goals they needed to advance. This team has so much attacking talent, but Roberto Martinez STILL hasn't figured out to make it work. De Bruyne, Mertens, and Carrasco all are not playing in a system that gets the most out of them, and a midfield two of Witsel and De Bruyne doesn't provide enough cover against talented teams. They looked defensively vulnerable all game against Japan, and could have conceded more.

If Belgium can find a new system for this game and overload the midfield against Brazil, they could move on to the Semifinals. If they come out in the same 343 they've been using, Fernandinho, Paulinho, and Coutinho will have full control of the midfield and the game. Belgium has enough talent to get past Brazil, but they don't have the right setup.

##### Brazil 2-1 Belgium

#### Sweden v England

It's Coming Home. Need I say more? England showed great mental fortitude to overcome Colombia in a dirty, physical game. Harry Kane is the top scorer of the World Cup and has quietly been the best player of the tournament as well. Besides the goals, he's provided great hold up play, helped in possession, and tracked back on defense too. He's also been a calming presence up front. Having a player who can score penalties in the World Cup and doesn't crack under the pressure or lose his cool when targeted with fouls can be a great influence on the rest of the team, and that is what Harry Kane has done. While Dele, Lingard, and Sterling haven't shown their best form yet here, they don't have crippling amounts of pressure on them due to Kane's brilliance. Look for Dele to have a great game here if he's given a little time on the ball.

For Sweden, they've put in some great performances this tournament, but have never looked completely great. Even when they beat Mexico 3-0, it felt more due to Mexico falling apart than their own brilliance. Fittingly against Switzerland, they had a great attacking move in the leadup to Forsberg's goal, but it took a huge deflection off of a Switzerland defender in order for it to actually get in the net.

England will look to possess the ball, whip in crosses from Trippier to Kane, and steadily beat down Sweden's defense. Sweden will likely succumb.

##### England 2-0 Sweden

#### Russia v Croatia

Frankly, Russia are the worst team left in the tournament. Spain tried to commit Death by a Thousand Passes on them, but that backfired once they were reminded there is an actual time limit to soccer matches. They did look good in their first two group games, but Uruguay exposed them as very vulnerable. Spain should have done the same, but honestly played with zero attacking intent at all.

For Croatia, this is a great opportunity to get to the semifinals or even the finals. They are low-key the most balanced team in the tournament, with star quality players in goal, defense, midfield and attack. Modric, Rakitic, and one of Brozovic or Kovacic is the best midfield three in the tournament. They should like their chances against any team they come up against.

Croatia are a great team, and Russia are very average. Even if the fix comes in from the refs, Croatia should come out on top and claim the title for best Slavic nation at the World Cup.
