The new Premier League season starts in less than 12 hours, so I won't write too much. This is mainly for posterity so I can see how my wrong I was at the end of the season.

### Hot Takes

#### Liverpool will regress significantly this season

They don't have much left in the tank, and they will run out of gas this season after running on fumes during the restart earlier this summer. I don't expect a total meltdown like Tottenham last year, but they will not break any records for points this season. Simply put, they will drop points this year that they haven't the past two seasons.

#### Harry Kane will win the Golden Boot

H is back, baby! I'm going full Homer-mode this year, and I'll fully on board the Kane Train. Mourinho will see him poaching more than ever before, and scoring all kinds of shithouse goals.

### Table prediction

City will win it. Chelsea as #3 will be a lot closer to Liverpool than people expect. Tottenham at #4 as the best of the rest. Man United won't get as many penalties as they are used to. Arsenal and Wolves neck and neck, and Everton will be pretty pretty good. Leicester will continue their post-lockdown form and struggle to find consistency, but still have some good Wins. Sheffield United will be good not great, Southampton about the same. The rest are unremarkable. Villa, Fulham and West Brom regulated, with Crystal Palace barely staying up.
